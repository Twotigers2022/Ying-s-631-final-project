# Intro

## What
This project is about US winter Olympic medalists for the past 20-30 years.
## Why
The reason I chose this topic is because winter Olympic just finished this year in Beijing, China. I did see some improvements of Chinese athletes this year, it seems that they won some gold medals that were big challenges for them in the past. I am curious to know how has Team US been doing, for example, some of the winter games Team US have been quite good at 10 years ago, are they still leaders?
## How
I will create a excel file than contains data of US Winter Olympics from year 2002 to year 2022.
